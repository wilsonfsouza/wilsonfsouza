I'm a Brazilian GIS Specialist and Software Engineer living in the United States since 2018. 

Currently I'm focused on:
- 📚 Studying the ArcGIS REST API, Flask, and Pytest for my position at the Spatial Studies Lab at Rice University.
- 👨‍💻 Studying more in depth about TDD with React and React Native apps.
